What is software quality assurance
----------

	Software Quality Engineering is a method to meet people's exceptation of software quality. The purpose is easy to understand, but the definition of "good quality" is difficult to say.
	"There must be some bugs in a program". The more complicated the software is, the more correct these words are. You can't make sure that there isn't any bug in your programs. What I said just now is totally a aspect of a programer, but may be the user even don't understand what is a bug. Users only care about that the software can do sth and can do sth right, and it is good enough to pay for it. It's the most important aspect about quality. But to be a engineer, there are losts of thing to care from the inside aspect of a project. Cost and time are important too for a manager. So, software quality is procedure throughout the life of software.
	It belong to definition of software quality engineering, and testing is the mostly uesd method to assure the quality of woftware.
	
How to do Software quality assurance
----------

	There are lots of ways to assure the quality of software. Testing is the best way to find the bad things of our programs. But testing is cheap, the cost that we fix bugs may beyond our exceptation. So we may need some methods smarter than debug to increase the quality of software. It is difficult and we need to learn about that.
